I am a software developer from Albany NY.

I enjoy programming, playing guitar, watching movies and hiking.

I really love building new things with software, hardware, and/or construction.

It is always great to work on projects with new people, so contact me if you
would like to collaborate!

#### Tools I use on a daily basis

 -  [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
 -  [TMUX](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
 -  [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
 -  [Rspec](https://rspec.info/)
