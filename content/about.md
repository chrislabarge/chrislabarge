I am a web developer from Albany NY and the creator of <a href="/projects/menuberry">MenuBerry</a>. Recently, I married my soulmate Jessica. I enjoy programming, playing guitar, watching movies and hiking. I really love building new things with software, hardware, and/or construction. It is always great to work on projects with new people, so contact me if you would like to collaborate!
