This is a project I did for a client that needed an online presence for his roofing business.  I built him a static website using the GOlang <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> generator, and hosted it on github pages.  I than integrated it with <a href="https://www.forestry.io">Forestry.io<a/> to allow for a CMS like expeprience.  He can now update content on the fly without having to pay a monthly fee.
