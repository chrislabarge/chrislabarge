This is a simple words per minute typing calculator. I built it using the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the CLIENT as well as the server. I did not write a single line of Javascript, as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript.  You can read about how I made this simple app <a href='/posts/typing-speed-calulator/'> here </a>.
