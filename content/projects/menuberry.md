MenuBerry is resource for vegans to discover food options at restaurants.

I built MenuBerry part-time for about year. It started as a hobby project
that eventually grew. Visitors could utilize the application as a resource to
find restaurants and vegan menu items.  Registered users were allowed to
contribute content and receive updates about their favorite restaurants.
