MenuBerry is a app for vegans to discover what to eat at restaurants.

I have been building MenuBerry part-time for the last year or so.  It started as a hobby project that eventually grew over time. It is still in the early days, but it's fully functional for people to use.
Visitors can utlize the application by using it as a resource to find restaurants and vegan options, as well as sign up to receive updates plus contribute content.
