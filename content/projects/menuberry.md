MenuBerry is resource for vegans to discover food options at restaurants.

I have been building MenuBerry part-time for the last year or so.  It started as a hobby project that eventually grew over time. It is still in the early days, but it's fully functional.
Visitors can utilize the application as a resource to find restaurants and vegan options.  Registered users are allowed to and contribute content and receive updates about their favorite restaurants.
