MenuBerry is a resource for vegans to discover what to eat at restaurants.

I have been building the web app MenuBerry part-time for the last year or so.  It started just as a resume app/hobby probject but I started to come up with features that I thought others could utlize. And started to develop soely on the app. It was built with the Ruby on Rails framework.
